<font size = 8>1 Overview </font>   
  Southeast Asia is often prone to conflict due to its relatively backward economic status and large number of small countries. This post mainly analyzes the frequency, region and type of conflict in Southeast Asia in recent years through the distribution map of conflict occurrence.

<font size = 8>2 Critiques and Suggestion </font> 
  
```{r,out.width='80%',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('Pictures/01.jpg')
```
  
<font size = 6>2.1 Clarity </font>  
In this segment, we will explore ways we can improve the visual clarity of this visualisation.  
2.1.1 No introduction about the visualization  
  There is no lead-in paragraph in this visualization, which means nothing can help reader to    understand what exactly the chart express,
2.1.2 Dense and small dots  
  Due to the points on the map overlap each other (highlighted below), the map does not clearly show the frequency of events in each region.  
2.1.3 Synchronised y-axis lable  
  The scale of the y-axis of these charts are not synchronised under different event. Besides, the y-axis tick marks are of varying scale for Armed Conflict Event by Type. Should the user miss to notice this, the user will be comparing the event counts and trends incorrectly.  
2.1.4 No country name  
  There is no country name on the map which would make reader confused with the conflict location.  
2.1.5 Toolip information not enough  
  The toolip information could include more useful information such as 'notes', 'Event date'.  
  
<font size = 6>1.2 Asethetics </font>  
2.2.1 Single Filter   
  Reader could not get enough information or comparison between countries or different years due to the limit of the single filter.   
2.2.2 Single color in different event types   
  The line chart should be colored accordingly by Event Type for consistency. There are different colors of Event Type in map, it should be same in line chart.   
2.2.3 No indication of data source  
  There is no indication of data source in the map and chart.
  
<font size = 8>3 Proposed Design </font>  
  
```{r,out.width='80%',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('Pictures/02.jpg')
```
  
<font size = 6> Improvements </font>   
3.1 Add some useful information into toolip like 'Notes', ' Event date', 'Fatalities'.  
3.2 Make three maps from conflict status, fatalities status and geolocoation aspect, which will give reader basic knowledge of conlicts condition in SouthEast Asia.  
3.3 For better visualization, map and chart will use same color for different event types.  
3.4 Three filters 'Year', 'Event Type', 'Country' give reader free space to choose what they want to analysis.

<font size = 8>4 Step-by-step Description </font>  
<font size = 6>4.1 Data Preparation </font>  

1. Drag the data file 'Southeast-Asia_2010-2020_Oct31' onto Tableau.  

```{r,out.width='80%',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('Pictures/03.jpg')
```
2. Change the Year to Date.  

```{r,out.width='80%',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('Pictures/04.jpg')
```

<font size = 6>4.2 Analysis Preparation </font> 

3. Create Parameter 'Analysis Angle'.  

```{r,out.width='80%',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('Pictures/06.jpg')
```

4. Create Calculation field 'Chart Type Filter'.  

```{r,out.width='80%',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('Pictures/07.jpg')
```

5. Create Calculation field 'Confilct' to count the number of conflicts.  

```{r,out.width='80%',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('Pictures/08.jpg')
```

<font size = 6>4.3 Make Analysis of Geolocation </font>  

6. Drag the existed measure value “Longitude” on columns and “Latitude” on rows instead of the longitude and latitude that tableau automatically generated for us.

```{r,out.width='80%',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('Pictures/05.jpg')
```

7. drag other measure names into the Marks.  
```{r,out.width='80%',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('Pictures/09.jpg')
```

8. Drag 'Country', 'Year', 'Event Type', 'Chart Type Filter' into filter.  

```{r,out.width='80%',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('Pictures/10.jpg')
```

9. For parameter 'Analysis Angle' click on show parameter and   
show the fiter 'Country', 'Year', 'Event Type'. Here is the final map.  

```{r,out.width='80%',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('Pictures/11.jpg')
```

<font size = 6>4.4 Make Analysis of Conflict and Fatalities Status </font>  

10. Drag the existed measure value “Longitude” on columns and “Latitude” on   
rows as well and drag measure names into marks.  

```{r,out.width='80%',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('Pictures/12.jpg')
```

11. Drag the filter values into Flilter and the final map is below.  

```{r,out.width='80%',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('Pictures/13.jpg')
```

12. Duplicate 'Conflict Status' and change the Sum(conflicts) to Fatalities.  

```{r,out.width='80%',out.heighth='10%',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('Pictures/14.png')
```
  
  
```{r,out.width='80%',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('Pictures/15.png')
```
  
<font size = 6>4.5 Make Analysis of Line Charts </font>   

13. Drag the 'Year' to columns and 'Confilct' to rows.  

```{r,out.width='80%',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('Pictures/16.jpg')
```

14. Drag the chart type filter into Filter and choose 'Conflict Status'.  

```{r,out.width='80%',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('Pictures/17.jpg')
```

15. Drag 'Event Type' onto colors and the final chart is below.  

```{r,out.width='80%',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('Pictures/18.jpg')
```

16. Duplicate the 'Conflict Line' and replace the 'Conflicts' with 'Fatalities'.  
```{r,out.width='80%',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('Pictures/19.jpg')
```

17. Choose 'Fatalities' for 'Chart Type Filter'.  

```{r,out.width='80%',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('Pictures/20.jpg')
```

<font size = 6>4.6 Dashboard Design </font>  
 
18. Drag 'Vertical' to the dashboard and then drag 'Geolocation' sheet into it, 
choose automatic for dashboard size.  

```{r,out.width='80%',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('Pictures/21.png')
```

19. Hide the 'Geolocation' title.  

```{r,out.width='80%',fig.align='center'}

```


<font size = 6>5 Observations </font>   

5.1 Conflicts in SouthEast Asia
  From the two graph below we can see that in South-east Asia, conflicts happened 
the most in Philippines, Myanmar. The rest region has relatively less conflicts 
and there are no conflicts happened in Singapore between 2010 and 2020.  

```{r,out.width='80%',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('Pictures/31.png')
```

```{r,out.width='80%',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('Pictures/32.png')
```


  Besides, in Geolocation map Philippines and Myanmar have more circles as well,
which means there are lots of event occurred in this two places.  

```{r,out.width='80%',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('Pictures/33.jpg')
```


5.2 Conflicts in Myanmar  
  As we can see from the Conflict Status map, Myanmar has the Heaviest color in
SouthEast Asia between 2015-2020. Besides, battles account for the largest 
proportion of them from the bar below.  

```{r,out.width='80%',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('Pictures/28.jpg')
```


5.3 Conflicts in Philippines
  The Philippines is another area that has a lot of conflicts every year in 
Southeast Asia. The difference from Myanmar is that 'Violence against civilians' 
account for the largest proportion of the conflicts.  

```{r,out.width='80%',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('Pictures/29.jpg')
```
  However, from the bar below, we can see that 'Violence against civilians' in 
Philippines has a descending trend these years.  

```{r,out.width='80%',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('Pictures/30.jpg')
```
